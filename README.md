***Kristin Lee JS Project Proposal***

    This project is about visualizing world population changes.
    Population changes are reflected and configured with real time data, so that users can immediately see and feel the differences.
    Visualization will be implemented through three.js.
    External API / data sources will be UN, WHO, United States Census Bureau, and worldometer.
    Data corresponding to the categories below will be extracted and visualized.

    - total world population
    - death/birth count today
    - death/birth count this year
    - people who died of hunger today
    - suicides this year

    Each category will be linked to new view page which will show the visual data.
    Graphics will be animated but each single objects will be very simple and basic.



* Technologies, Libraries, APIs
    three.js



* Implementation Timeline

    - Friday Afternoon & Weekend: build the base code and skeleton for 1) extracting data, 2) visualization
    - Monday: Set the aesthetic part, add visual decorations to view page
    - Tuesday: add more features if possible
    - Wednesday: Refine and finalize the project
