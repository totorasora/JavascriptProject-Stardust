## from developer
    Hello, welcome to my little page!
    I made this page hoping that people would have
    a special moment of experience through visual/auditory effects
    and think about life/death and other people
    living in different environments in the world.
    Only population growth page is in various colors
    because it's about new lives not death,
    Colors and spiral move represent diversity and harmony.
    Other pages are about death data so I made them to stars.
    We are all made of stars and we will all go back to stardust one day.
    Hope you enjoy it!
