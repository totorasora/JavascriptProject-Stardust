## from developer
    Hello, welcome to my little page!
    I made this webpage hoping that people would have
    a special moment of experience through visual/auditory effects
    and think about life/death and other people
    living in different environments in the world.
    We are all made of stars and we will all go back to stardust.
    Hope you enjoy it!
